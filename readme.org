* git-rebase-mode
The latest version of "magit/git-rebase.el" is coupled with magit too much, it means that we can use it in standalone.

So the old version which doesn't depend on magit is copied from magit repo, and it can be used in standalone.

As magit has performace issue on windows platform, normally I disabled it, so that the standalone way is important.
